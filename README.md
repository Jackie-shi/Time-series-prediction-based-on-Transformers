# ðŸ¤— Time series prediction based on Transformers

This repository contains a code fulfillment of time series prediction using NLP model - Tansformers. More specifically, I use stock price data from [Nasdaq-traded historical dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacksoncrow/stock-market-dataset?datasetId=541298) to train the model. So you can call this time series prediction task as stock price predictionðŸ¤¥. \
The aim of this repo is to show how to build a Transformer model for structural time squence data and provide a complete baseline for this task.


# ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used in this task is [Nasdaq-traded historical dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacksoncrow/stock-market-dataset?datasetId=541298). In this dataset, there are tow directories named `etfs` and `stocks` respectively. Within each of both directories, there are thousands of `csv` format files representing different companies stock or etf data. \

In each file, there are several features:

- Date - specifies trading date
- Open - opening price
- High - maximum price during the day
- Low - minimum price during the day
- Close - close price adjusted for splits
- Adj Close - adjusted close price adjusted for both dividends and splits.
- Volume - the number of shares that changed hands during a given day

Here take NAV.csv as example:

# ðŸ§  Model

According to this [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), Transformer is consists of Encoder and Decoder.
